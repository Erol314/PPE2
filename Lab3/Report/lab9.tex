\makeatletter
%%The \makeatletter command temporarily defines »@« as a normal character to enable changes to internal LaTeX macros outside packages (STY) or classes (CLS).
\let\thetitle\@title
%%\let allows you to copy the content of a command into a new command.
\let\theauthor\@author
%%Thus \let\foo\bar defines \foo to have the value that \bar had at the point of definition.
\makeatother
% With \makeatother this process is reversed and the »@« is set to its original character category (other). The »@« is used to protect the internal LaTeX macros. Hence you should be very careful when using these two commands.
\pagestyle{fancy}
%%After that, the "fancy" style is set by \pagestyle{fancy}
\fancyhf{}
%%The command \fancyhf{} clears the header and footer, otherwise the elements of the default "plain" page style will appear. 
\rhead{\theauthor}
%%Prints the text included inside the braces on the right side of the header. 
\lhead{\thetitle}
%%Prints the text set inside the braces on the left side of the header.
\cfoot{\thepage}
%%\cfoot{Page \thepage}  Prints the word "Page" and next the page number which is automatically set by \thepage on the center of the footer.

                %• origin = location3 — the point about which rotation is to occur %• draft = true/false — prevents figure from being imported, but created a named box with the dimensions of the figure (this option is used to speed up processing)

        \end{itemize}


        \subsection*{Tasks:}
        During This Laboratory Work i Did a windows Application which is pretty similar to Classic Windows Paint. User Can Draw lines on different Shape and weights, Adjusting the line weight by introducing the the Brush size number between 1 and 200
        \begin{figure}[H]
                \centering
                \includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{img1.png}
                \caption{Lines}
        \end{figure}
        \begin{figure}[H]
                \centering
                \includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{img2.png}
                \caption{Lines}
        \end{figure}
        \vspace{0.5 cm}

        User can Set Bezier curve Mode and draw it placing three points with the mouse on drawing area.
        \begin{figure}[H]
                \centering
                \includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{img3.png}
           
        \end{figure}
        \begin{figure}[H]
                \centering
                \includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{img4.png}
                \caption{Bezier curve}
        \end{figure}
        \vspace{0.5 cm}

        Also user can draw objects like Polygons or Ellipses 
        \begin{figure}[H]
                \centering
                \includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{img6.png}
             
        \end{figure}
        \begin{figure}[H]
                \centering
                \includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{img5.png}
                
        \end{figure}
        \vspace{0.5 cm}
        User can erase everything on drawing area using his mouse, Eraser width can be adjusted. 
        \begin{figure}[H]
                \centering
                \includegraphics[width=.4\textwidth]{img7.png}
             
        \end{figure}
        \begin{figure}[H]
                \centering
                \includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{img8.png}
                \caption{Eraser}
        \end{figure}
        \vspace{0.5 cm}
       Also i added a switch, it changes the ability to draw objects( they can be ether filled or not). Also i have implemented here 2 Hotkeys, same as in previous lab: "Alt + L" and "Alt + N"
       \begin{figure}[H]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=.9\textwidth]{img9.png}
        \caption{Overall}
        \end{figure}
   
        \newpage
        \subsection*{Conclusion}
        During This lab work i Understand the key features of WinApi Like list boxes, Menu, and how to add custom elements. The hardest part was repositioning all window elements on scrolling.
