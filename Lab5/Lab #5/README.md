    * (1 pt) Divide tasks and describe them in readme (for each task indicate who is responsible for it)
    * (2 pt) Use pull requests in order to merge your code
* (0-3 pt) Make it useful (you may be asked to evaluate the usefulness of your application)
* (1 pt) First, create a sketch then work on code

### Tasks and points:
* (NaN) Created an application with child window controls
* (NaN) Created an application with GDI animations
* (2 pt) Used pull requests in order to merge my code
* (3 pt) Made an useful application, for spending time by playing a simple game and improving memory.
* (1 pt) Firstly created a sketch then worked on application code

### Window features

This laboratory work was performed using C# language. It is much more easy to write programs in C# as it's ready to create forms with visual designer. Inside my window, I have a table layout grid where I put my labels with text. The icons used in application are not images, they are letters with specific system font. That's why adding more rows or columns become much more easy.


### Functionality

* User must match all icons in order to finish the game
* User have option to change the timer interval that hides icons, if they are not the same (this is made for those who need more time to remember icon locations)
* Game grid size can be changed from settings window that opens when user clicks on "EDIT" label on the right bottom side of window
* If user matches all icons then application congratulates him and closes the application
* Every time application is launched, the positions and icons are randomly changed
