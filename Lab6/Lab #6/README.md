### Window features

In this laboratory work I wrote one of my previous works in C# language (a todo list). It is much more easy to write programs in C# as it's ready to create forms with visual designer. Inside my window, I have a list box where I add new todo items. There is possibilities to either add or remove an item from the todo list. Every item is locally saved in a file which makes it easy to keep track of your todos.


### Functionality

* User types a todo then presses on "Add" button to add it to the global list.
* If user wants to remove or completed a task, he can double click on an item and confirm his action with a message box to delete an item from the list.
* Every item is saved in a file upon addition to listbox
* When program starts, it takes all the todo items from a file and puts them in list box.
